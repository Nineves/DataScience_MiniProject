# DataScience_MiniProject
The entire codebase includes 2 parts:
1. Movie Revenue Prediction (codes)
   The main codes of the project, including data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization and regression prediction model.
 
2. Data extraction & collection (codes)
   The data preparation codes, showing the process of extracting movie information from TMDB webpages and integrating the  
   collected data into a csv file called 'movie_data.csv'.
  （Since the 'movie_data.csv' file is not very large, we zip it in file together.)
  
  
We also attached our presentation ppt ‘Mini-project presentation’ in the file.
